## Introduction
In contrast to animals that have completed their organ formation before birth, the plants continue to produce organs throughout their life cycle. The continuous formation of organs is very important to the plant development and growth; therefore understanding such feature can potentially improve the yield in many crop plants and benefit agriculture and food industry. 

	Shoot apical meristem (SAM) is responsible for the continous growth of plant organs. It 
is a region in a growing shoot consisting of self-renewing stem cells that can be transitioned into different specialized cell types such as leaf and flower cells, therefore playing an important part in the formation of aboveground organs/tissues [1]. 

The undifferentiated status of SAM is found to be maintained by Class I knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX) transcription factors. Studies have show that KNOX genes are specifically expressed in SAM, and the overexpression of KNOX in leaves would affect the leaf growth pattern while loss of KNOX genes would result in failure of SAM formation and maintenance[2]. KNOW were also found to be involved in regulating growth-promoting hormone cytokinin biosynthesis, as well as in regulating biosynthesis of cell wall components such as lignin and gibberellin [2]. Yet, we have not completely understood how the KNOX genes contribute to the maintenance of indeterminacy of SAM.

OSH1 is one of the KNOX transcription factors (TFs) in rice (Oryza sativa). OSH1 was found to regulate the signaling pathway of brassinosteroids, a group of hormones promoting differentiation in meristem cells [3]. To gather a better understanding of this KNOX gene function, I planned to run a genome-wide analysis of the OSH1 downstream pathway hoping to find a comprehensive set of target genes of OSH1 and build its gene regulatory network.
